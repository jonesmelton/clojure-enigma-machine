input: string

1. turn strings into lists of character
2. we give it a letter and it returns an index
3. then we'll need a fn that, we give it an index and it makes that be the first item in the list
4.

character into another character

Concerns:
- How to save state between rotars? (!!!)
  perhaps just a matter of carefully structuring our functions within each other and
  declaring recursion effectively. Can't just recur anywhere.
