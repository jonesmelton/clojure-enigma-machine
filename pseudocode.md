input: string

1. turn strings into lists of character
2. we give it a letter and it returns an index
3. then we'll need a fn that, we give it an index and it makes that be the first item in the list
4.

character into another character

Concerns:
- How to save state between rotars? (!!!)
  perhaps just a matter of carefully structuring our functions within each other and
  declaring recursion effectively. Can't just recur anywhere.

Function List

- Input: letter, Output: index
- Input: index,  Output: letter

Fn to rotate a rotar ; may be called in different circumstances.
Fn to determine if rotar should be rotated.

'("ABCDEFGH...")

ROTOR HOW

1 rotate rotor
2 get index of letter in raw alphabet
3 get letter at that index on rotor wheel
4 get index of that letter on rotor alphabet

SET-ROTOR WHY.

0. input: character and rotor
1. get index of character in ALPHABET
2. TAKE index (number of elements) from beginning of list
    and concat them on to the end.
3.

n. output: rotor
